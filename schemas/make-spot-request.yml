title: "Make a spot request"
description: |
  Presented here are the fields that are absolutely 100% required to make a
  spot request.  The `LaunchSpecification` property is an opaque datastructure
  from EC2, however the fields which we know are absolutely required are
  described
type: object
properties:
  ClientToken:
    type: string
    description: |
      A ClientToken string per the implementation requirements of the EC2 api.
      This string must be no more than 64 characters of ASCII.  We restrict the
      client tokens further to alphanumeric ASCII with the addition of the `-`
      and `_` characters
    minLength: 1
    maxLength: 64
    pattern: "^[a-zA-Z0-0_-]{1,64}"
  Region:
    type: string
    description: |
      The EC2 region in which this spot request is to be made.  This should be
      the lower case api-identifier.  For example `us-east-1`
  SpotPrice:
    type: number
    description: |
      The actual price of the bid.  This is passed directly to the EC2 api and
      so should not have any internal multipliers (e.g. capacity or utility)
      applied
  LaunchSpecification:
    type: object
    description: |
      This is a LaunchSpecification as specified by the EC2 API.  We do
      validate a few of the fields which are absolutely critical to the
      functioning of the EC2-Manager.  Other fields are valid and passed
      directly to the EC2 API verbatim.  None of these values are changed by
      the EC2-Manager
    properties:
      KeyName:
        type: string
        description: |
          A valid EC2 KeyPair name.  The KeyPair must already exist
      InstanceType:
        type: string
        description: |
          The instance type to use for this spot request
      ImageId:
        type: string
        description: |
          This is the AMI Identifier for this spot request.  This image must
          already exist and must be in the region of the request.  Note that
          AMI images are per-region, so you must copy or regenerate the image
          for each region.
      SecurityGroups:
        type: array
        description: |
          This is a list of the security groups this image will use.  These
          groups must already exist in the region.
        items:
          type: object
    requiredProperties:
      - KeyName
      - InstanceType
      - ImageId
      - SecurityGroups  
    # NOTE: We might want in future to block out certain keys from being
    # allowed like Placement and instead move that to a property one level up
    # and do that substitution in the EC2-Manager rather than in the
    # provisioner to avoid a little more ec2-knowledge there.
additionalProperties: false
requiredProperties:
  - ClientToken
  - Region
  - SpotPrice
  - LaunchSpecification
