title: "Make a spot request"
description: |
  Presented here are the fields that are absolutely 100% required to make a
  spot request.  The `LaunchSpecification` property is an opaque datastructure
  from EC2, however the fields which we know are absolutely required are
  described
type: object
properties:
  ClientToken:
    type: string
    description: |
      A ClientToken string per the implementation requirements of the EC2 api.
      This string must be no more than 64 characters of ASCII.  We restrict the
      client tokens further to alphanumeric ASCII with the addition of the `-`
      and `_` characters
    minLength: 1
    maxLength: 64
    pattern: "^[a-zA-Z0-0_-]{1,64}"
  Region:
    type: string
    description: |
      The EC2 region in which this spot request is to be made.  This should be
      the lower case api-identifier.  For example `us-east-1`
  RequestType:
    type: string
    enum: 
      - 'spot'
      - 'on-demand'
    description: |
      Specify whether to use a spot request or an on-demand instance.  This is
      not inferred from the SpotPrice being set or not because we want to allow
      for the default behaviour for spot prices, which is to use the spot
      market with a default price of the on-demand price
  SpotPrice:
    type: number
    description: |
      The actual price of the bid.  This is passed directly to the EC2 api and
      so should not have any internal multipliers (e.g. capacity or utility)
      applied
  LaunchInfo:
    type: object
    description: |
      This is an EC2-Manager specific wrapping of the request body for the
      upstream EC2 API.  Values from this are passed through verbatim.  A small
      number of checks are done on the data before making the call, as well as
      having some schema keys set to ensure certain values are either present
      or absent
    properties:
      KeyName:
        type: string
        description: |
          A valid EC2 KeyPair name.  The KeyPair must already exist
      InstanceType:
        type: string
        description: |
          The instance type to use for this spot request
      ImageId:
        type: string
        description: |
          This is the AMI Identifier for this spot request.  This image must
          already exist and must be in the region of the request.  Note that
          AMI images are per-region, so you must copy or regenerate the image
          for each region.
      SecurityGroups:
        type: array
        description: |
          This is a list of the security groups this image will use.  These
          groups must already exist in the region.
        items:
          type: string
      # NOTE: I'm not totally sure how to use the not json-schema system to
      # block the InstanceMarketOptions key, but we'll be determining that
      # value that internally
    requiredProperties:
      - KeyName
      - InstanceType
      - ImageId
      - RequestType
      - SecurityGroups  
    # NOTE: We might want in future to block out certain keys from being
    # allowed like Placement and instead move that to a property one level up
    # and do that substitution in the EC2-Manager rather than in the
    # provisioner to avoid a little more ec2-knowledge there.
additionalProperties: false
requiredProperties:
  - ClientToken
  - Region
  - LaunchInfo
